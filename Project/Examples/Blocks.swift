    // asynchronously. The only obligation is that the block must invoke the
    // `finish` block argument when finished, or else the AsyncBlockOperation
    // will remain stuck in the isExecuting state indefinitely.
    
    // For example, even though the execution blocks for the `one`, `two`, and
    // `three` operations below exit scope before each of their `.asyncAfter()` 
    // calls fire, each operation will remain in its executing state until the 
    // `finish` handlers are invoked. This allows you to make each operation
    // depend upon the previous via `.addDependency()`.
